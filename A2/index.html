		"Nanook sees the creation of the universe as a mistake and seeks to destroy everything. After ascending to Aeonhood, Nanook allegedly ignited THEIR home world. Despite being the most recently ascended Aeon, Nanook and THEIR minions may already be considered the greatest menace in all the galaxy.",
		"Lan harbors an intense hatred towards Yaoshi the Abundance and the undead abominations created by THEM. THEY tirelessly hunt them down, driven by the devastation the Abundance caused on THEIR homeworld. In contrast with the other Aeons, Lan pays close attention to mortals. THEY often appear before them, but move too fast to be seen, the only portents of THEIR presence being vestiges of the Lux Arrow tearing across the sky.",
		"None can comprehend their intentions, location, or normal state. Nous is a machine intelligence that has been upgraded into an Aeon, calculating the essence of the universe and its ultimate solution. THEY are not a god that provides solutions. All THEY offer is an infinite number of questions. Visiting Nous is enough to open the eyes of even the most ignorant people, but answers may only be found by oneself.",
		"Xipe is the amalgamation of thousands of entities that preaches the joy of human harmony and unity hailing from multiple harmonious celestial worlds. THEY absorbed Ena the Order when the former ascended into an Aeon due to THEIR colliding paths nearing the end of the Swarm Disaster.",
		"IX is an apathetic Aeon, believing existence is absolutely meaningless, so doing anything is worthless. THEY don't interact with other Aeons and THEIR existence is a mystery. Just being near IX's form can make one feel numbed and dejected.",
		"Qlipoth strives to isolate contact between planets. The celestial-sized structures THEY'VE built — the Subspace Crystalline Barrier — separates and protects the living worlds from being devoured by their enemy. There is a theory called ''Catastrophe Theory'' that states that when the hammer swings and a new amber era begins, a catastrophy is imminent.",
		"Yaoshi's benevolent nature led THEM to grant THEIR blessing upon anyone who seeks immortality. However, the consequences of these blessings often result in a fate worse than death."
